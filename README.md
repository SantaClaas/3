A web component library for me to reuse components I otherwise often duplicate in different projects

# Things to check out

- [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/docs/getting-started) for creating multiple libraries for each component in a single repository. Based on [Web Component Factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wcfactory/cli)

# TODO

-[ ] Set defaults for not provided CSS Variables to achieve components looking acceptable without configuration
