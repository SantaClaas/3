# <3-Components>

A web component library for me to reuse components I otherwise often duplicate in different projects
3, because 3 is my favorite number.

## Things I am using or used

_...and want to give credit to_

- [material.io](https://material.io) by Google because it is a great design system resource to get starting and base the design on.
- The different specifications that make up web components like custom elements' ["what is a valid custom element name"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name)
- [HTML with Superpowers](https://htmlwithsuperpowers.netlify.app/) by Dave Rupert
- [Open Web Components](https://open-wc.org/) to scaffold this project
- [Lit](https://list.dev/) to make it easier writing web components
- Great YouTube videos that I found very informative
  - [Design at scale with Web Components (and ducks)](https://youtu.be/DBcz_bGcHgk) presented by Liz Mitchell and Rody Davis on Google Chrome Developers
  - [GUI Challenges](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAaV1wwI9540OC_3XoIzMjQ] presented by Adam Argyle on Google Chrome Developers
  - [Creating Web Components - With Special Guest Dave Rupert!](https://youtu.be/Sq5oiHjwFxI) presented by Dave Rupert and Kevin Powell

## Things I want to try

- The components from [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) to base my own on them for when there is something that native HTML does not provide.
- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) seems to be a great base line for styling and will make things easier
